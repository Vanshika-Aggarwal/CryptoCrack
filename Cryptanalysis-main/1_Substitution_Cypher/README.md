# Substitution Cypher

We firstly started with looking after monograms but there were several occurrences with a single letter and the spacing was also incomprehensible. This implies that spacing was also disturbed in the cipher text.
Then we did a frequency analysis of letters present.
We made observations in the following order:
- On basis of frequency analysis, "c" was substituted with "e"
- There were several occurrences of "fic" which implies "the"
- THok has three occurence, can be most probably THIS   
- "THE mE" and "THEmE" implies THERE and also "I qTEmEST" implied "INTEREST"
- "dgRE INTE RE STIN aTHhN" implied "MORE INTE RE STIN GTHAN" 
- "jASSlOR yIS" implied "PASSWOR DIS"
- "NOT HINGO eI NTEREST" implied "NOT HINGO FI NTEREST"
- "TWITHOvTTHE xvOTES" implied "TWITHOUTTHE QUOTES"
- "TH EpOD EUSE DFO RTHI SMES SAG EISA SIMPuE" implied "TH ECOD EUSE DFO RTHI SMES SAG EISA SIMPLE"
- "IRST CH AMn EROFT HECAsES" implies "IRST CH AMB EROFT HECAVES"
- "IT SHAVE BEENSH IFTE DBr2 PLACES" implies "IT SHAVE BEENSH IFTE DBY2 PLACES"
